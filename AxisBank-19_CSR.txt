Annual Report on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
Activities
(As prescribed under Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Companies (Corporate Social Responsibility Policy) Rules 
2014)
1. A brief outline of the Company’s CSR policy, including overview of projects or programs proposed to be undertaken and a 
reference to the web-link to the CSR policy and projects or programs. 
 The year gone by has been quite memorable for the Bank as it crossed an important milestone in its journey - completion 
of 25 years since its incorporation in December 1993. Through this momentous journey, the Bank has witnessed several 

transfor
 The transformations facilitated by the Bank’s CSR activities - be it economic, social or digital, have left strong imprints in
 the 
communities it has touched through its programs.
 The Bank’s CSR philosophy aims to make a meaningful and measurable impact in the lives of the deprived communities across 
the country which the Bank achieves through initiatives that seek to create conditions that enable sustainable livelihoods for 

the communities it serves. The Bank is continually making efforts to align its CSR activities with various Government Schemes 

like MNREGA.
 The CSR activities of the Bank are guided by its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Policy which has been formulated and 
adopted by the Bank in compliance with the provisions of Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 and is hosted on the 

Bank’s website 
www.axisbank.com
. The CSR Policy is reviewed annually by the CSR Committee and new focus areas, as 
found necessary, are included from time to time.
 The Bank executes its CSR activities directly by leveraging its geographical coverage to undertake such initiatives or through
 
Axis Bank Foundation (ABF) or in association with any other Trust or agencies and entities as deemed suitable. 
 The CSR activities directly undertaken by the Bank majorly focus on pover
, education and skill development and health and sanitation. 
 . With this aim in mind, ‘
Project Akshar
’ was 


knowledge. The platform has more than 2 lac registered users with a reach of more than 5 lac people with its geographical 
presence across the Metros, Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and the rural areas as well. The program has helped the users to improve 

their credit portfolios by learning about credit scores and its impact on their credit health, helped delinquent users understa
nd 
the consequences of non-payment and the future implications of these delinquencies. It has played a pivotal role in reducing 

the delinquencies by giving the users real-time experience of credit reporting with the help of their virtual credit score feat
ure. 
Going forward, the platform intends to spread its outreach across geographies through an ‘
Akshar Ambassador Program
’ 
m aspires to become a one-of-its-kind e-learning 
platform through adoption of various community based digital practices, which will include a forum where people can post 
and resolve their queries and can share their feedback and their success stories with the Bank.
 The Bank has been working towards strengthening India’s MSME sector under its ‘
Evolve
’ initiative, wherein it engages with 
the MSME sector through a series of knowledge sharing and skill development sessions. The series marked its 5
th
 edition this 
year and will cover 31 cities with an active participation of more than 3,000 SMEs. The series aims to bring forward Thought 

Leaders/Experts/Successful Entrepreneurs to give guidance and personal methodologies to SMEs on relevant business topics 
so as to help them to overcome challenges and compete in a complex environment with large organisations and agile start-
ups. In a world of start-ups springing new business ideas, creating new demand, the topic this year was how “
Innovation 
can help SMEs unlock business growth
”. Innovation in any form, be it product, process or pricing is the cornerstone for 
organisations to remain relevant in the fast paced and rapidly transforming environment they operate in. It is no different

for SMEs, who seek to build long term sustainable businesses. The speakers were industry experts and thought leaders, who 
shared their valuable experience and mantras for innovation. 
 India holds forth a great potential in terms of fostering women and youth empowerment especially in the low income group. 
Towards this end, the Bank reached out to women and youth eager to break the shackles of pover

better


up-skill the women to earvice 

providers, the program has been able to bring a gradual turn-around in the lives of these individuals. The Bank is also up-

skilling unemployed youth thus brightening their chances to access better employment opportunities. Healthcare has also 

been another aspect where the Bank facilitated basic diagnostic tests to help the individuals get a better grasp of the health 

condition and take remedial measures if required. The Bank also pro-actively supported relief measures in disaster-struck 

areas like Kerala and Odisha and provided relief kits and other measures aimed at alleviating the hardships of the affected 

disaster victims through its program “Axis Sahaayata”. 
 “
Axis DilSe
and thus create an enduring change in the region entered its 2
nd
 year. The program is aligned to the developmental model of 
the Government’s Border Area Development Program (BADP). Through this initiative, the Bank supports the transformation of 

108 schools in the remote villages of Leh and Kargil districts of Ladakh region in Jammu & Kashmir. 
 As part of the program, the Bank this year, enabled the setting-up of ‘DigiLabs’ in the designated schools. The unique feature
 
of DigiLabs has been that it is all powered by green energy viz: Solar power. The children in 108 schools now have access 

to curated educational content to help them familiarize topics in Maths, General Knowledge (GK), Environmental Studies 

(EVS), computers and phonetics at a pace that they can be comfortable with and in a joyful manner. The teachers in these 

schools have been trained in using the content that helps them impart curricular topics to the students thereby improving their
 
learning levels. An impact assessment conducted through an independent third party evaluator brought out that the program 

has created meaningful impact since its launch including enhanced exposure for the communities, enhanced quality of 

infrastructure facilities in the schools and active community and Government involvement.
 The digital transformation we have witnessed in these schools in some of the most remote areas of our countrms our 
belief in being able to use technology to reach out to the children in these areas and open up new avenues of learning for 

them.
 
ll 
ith a
 
view to increase awareness in this regard, the Bank supported an initiative that led to the conduction of a series of campaigns
 
and seminars across India on the RPWD Act. This initiative also sought to sensitize and equip organizations involved in 

skilling of youth to ensure that youth with disabilities are also included in mainstream training programmes.
 Recognizing the increasing concern of global warming and its ill effects on the environment, the Bank commenced undertaking 
green energy initiatives in its operations in order to reduce its carbon footprint. Towards this end, the Bank has installed 


includes the largest installation of 1.27 MW at Axis House, Noida at one single location. Further, the Bank has set up a 2 

MW solar plant by acquiring 8.59 acres of land at Sonalwadi village, Sangola taluka, Solapur through Open Access System 

which can generate 28 lakhs electricity units per annum and aims to reduce 2,296 tons of carbon emissions annually.
 The Bank has invested in “
Social Transformation
” by supporting initiatives aimed at improving the lives of the rural populace. 
Set up as a Public Charitable Trust in 2006, 
Axis Bank Foundation (ABF)
, the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) arm of 
Axis Bank Ltd. spearheads the CSR activities of the Bank with a focus on creating Sustainable Livelihoods. The Bank has also 

directly partnered with credible NGOs pan-India with an aim to create Sustainable Livelihoods for the intended participants 

that lead to an increase in their economic and social up-liftment. The Bank has engaged ABF to supervise and monitor 

these projects to ensure that the targeted objectives are met and the desired impact is created. ABF successfully achieved its 


impacting 2 million households by 2025.

 The building blocks of ABF’s livelihood approach are centred on creating enabling mechanisms and community centric 
institutions. Financial support is given to not-for

in the ‘local context’. The investments in patient capitals across natural, economic, human and social spheres translate into 

generating sustainable livelihood avenues. 
 Within the overarching theme of Sustainable livelihoods are the two sub-themes – Rural Livelihoods and Skill Development. 
The Rural Livelihoods program reaches out to small and marginal farmers and the landless in dryland regions by working 

on watershed management, agriculture and horticulture enhancement, livestock development, micro-enterprise development 

and promoting collectives. The approach is to work in areas that are most challenged and with highly depleted natural 

resources. Financial literacy and bank linkages are among the key elements of these programs. W

contributors to livelihoods and therefore efforts are made to empower them and connect them to enabling platforms. Incidence 

of migration tends to be high within rural communities, making women responsible for sustaining local livelihoods. It is, 

therefore, imperative to bring women into mainstream activities and the decision making process, thereby improving local 

governance. The enabling platforms such as SHGs and Producer Organizations help women take up a more assertive role 

that helps a faster transformation, which is also sustainable.
 Skill development, on the other hand, includes training rural and peri-urban youth, including Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)
 
in market-linked vocational skills and connecting them to jobs and/ or preparing them for entrepreneurial activities. It is 

important to consider the different aspirations of the rural youth. The practice of women restricting themselves to household 

chores and labouring in farms without wages is also changing fast, resulting in the need to create alternate livelihood 

engagements for young women through skill development programs. Close to 50% of our trainees are women.
 Capacity building is considered as a key attributor for sustainable outcomes and transformative change. First is strengthening
 
partner organization’s capacities, which in turn addresses their potential to scale viable solutions and collaborate further. 

Second is building capacities of communities that comprise of community resource persons and grassroots leaders who are 

intrinsically involved with the implementation of core interventions. ABF in parallel, has also focused on developing a learnin
g 
culture between their partner organizations and the Foundation. The outcomes evidenced have been social and economic 

transformation for the target communities. The sustainable livelihood programs also leverage Government Schemes like 

MNREGA. ABF has also signed MoUs with State Governments of Chhattisgarh, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Telangana 

and Maharashtra for various CSR interventions. The attempt is to collaborate with governments and other likeminded funders 

to scale up the impact and enable faster transformation.
 As part of Mission 2 Million (M2M), 4,47,182 households/trainees have been impacted of which 2,10,050 are new 
households/trainees onboarded in FY 2018-19. Partnerships have been forged with 29 credible NGOs and the programs 

cover 151 Districts in 23 States/UTs.
 An illustrative list of various programs and activities supported by ABF can be accessed at 
www.axisbankfoundation.org. 
 
 During the year, the Bank was awarded the CII-ITC Sustainability Award for “Excellence in Corporate Social Responsibility”. 
This is the second time, the Bank has been honoured with this award.
