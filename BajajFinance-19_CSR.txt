Introduction
 
The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities of the Bajaj Group are guided by the vision 
and philosophy of its Founding Father, late Shri Jamnalal Bajaj, who embodied the concept 
of trusteeship in business and common good and laid the foundation for ethical, value-based 
and transparent functioning.
 
Bajaj Group believes that the true and full measure of growth, success and progress lies 
beyond Balance Sheets or conventional economic indices. It is best reflected in the difference 
that business and industry make to the lives of people.
 
Through its social investments, the Bajaj Group addresses the needs of communities residing 
in the vicinity of its facilities, taking sustainable initiatives in the areas of health, education, 
environment conservation, infrastructure and community development, and response to 
natural calamities. For society, however, Bajaj is more than a corporate identity. It is a catalyst 
for social empowerment. It is the reason behind the smiles that light up a million faces.
 
Its goodwill resonates in the two simple words that live in the collective consciousness of 
Indians Œ ‚Hamara Bajaj™.
 
Guiding principles
 
The Bajaj group believes that social investments should:
 
Benefit Generations:
 The Company believes in ‚investment in resource creation™ for use 
over generations. The Company tries to identify sustainable projects which will benefit the 
society over long periods.
 
Educate for Self-Reliance and Growth:
 To usher in a growth oriented society and 
thereby a very strong and prosperous nation- by educating each and every Indian.
 
Promote Health:
 The Company believes that good health is a pre-requisite for both 
education and productivity.
 
Encourage for Self Help:
 To guide and do hand-holding for self-help, individually and 
collectively, to create excellence for self and for the team.
 
Be Focused:
 The Company believes that activities should be preferably focused around 
locations where the Company has its presence and hence can effectively guide, monitor 
and implement specific projects.
 
Target those who need it the most: 
Care for the sections of the society that are 
 
socially and economically at the lowest rung irrespective of their religion or caste or 
language or colour.
 
Sustain Natural Resources:
 The Company encourages balanced development and ensure 
least adverse impact on environment - ‚Growth with Mother Nature™s blessings™.
